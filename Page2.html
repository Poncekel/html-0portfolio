    <h1>Teaching Children</h1>
    <p>My teaching journey began as a pre-school teacher and team lead. 
      I enjoyed teaching and working with children so much that I got a degree in 
      Early Childhood Education. For 10+ years, I taught multiple grades and 
      implemented many curricula. I designed and delivered engaging lessons and 
      developed evaluation criteria such as rubrics and standards. 
      Analyzed assessment data to help reinforce skills students needed. 
      These experiences gave me the reward of witnessing students be successful 
      with the content I was teaching.</p>

      <h1>Teaching Adults</h1>
    <p>Teaching dance was an excellent way to merge two things I'm passionate about;
      teaching and dance. As a dance instructor, I developed and managed learning 
      content for my students and helped evaluate and train new staff members to 
      demonstrate the necessary and appropriate methodology for teaching various dance 
      forms. Recently, I collaborated with a studio owner to create a digital training 
      course on teaching strategies for new instructors. 
      The course helped prepare instructors to double the number of booked lessons!</p>

      <h1>EdTech & Training</h1>
    <p>As a teacher, I had to find creative ways to engage children in learning. 
      Technology allowed me to provide students with multiple methods for acquiring new 
      information. I became the person many teachers came to for tech questions. 
      This role led me to pursue a Master's in Educational Technology.</p>
      
      <p>I implemented my newly acquired knowledge of adult learning principles to upskill 
      colleagues. Throughout the pandemic, I was part of an EdTech team of volunteers to 
      help train staff on using and managing new LMSs, Zoom, and tech tools to engage 
      students and increase participation during distance learning. </p>

      <h1>Professional Goals</h1>
    <p>By completing my M.Ed. in Educational Technology, distance learning, and being part 
      of the EdTech committee at my school, I gained experience using multimedia learning 
      principles and the ADDIE Instructional Design model to develop web-based training 
      materials for other educators. </p>

      <p>My goal is to transition to a career where I can combine my knowledge and experience 
      of how people learn, technology, and creativity to create transformative digital learning 
      solutions for children or adults. 
      Other skills I am interested in developing are UI/UX design, HTML5, and  
      Project management.</p>
